1
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:45,557
My dear children,

2
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:50,550
it is now better than several years
since l moved to New York

3
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:54,633
and l haven't seen you
as much as l would like to.

4
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:58,749
l hope you will come to this ceremony
of Papal honours,

5
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:01,229
given for my charitable work.

6
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:06,552
The only wealth in this world is children.

7
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:09,712
More than all the money and power
on Earth.

8
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:12,795
You are my treasure.

9
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:16,430
Anthony and Mary,

10
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:21,151
although l entrusted your education to
your mother for your own best interest,

11
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:27,270
l look forward to seeing you, and to
a new period of harmony in our lives.

12
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:32,956
Perhaps you might prevail upon your
mother to come to this celebration,

13
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:38,240
and that from time to time, we can all
see each other at family functions.

14
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:43,716
Anyway, l remain your loving father.

15
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:15,358
Hail Mary, full of grace...

16
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:21,272
...blessed art Thou amongst women...

17
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:24,910
...and blessed is the fruit of Thy womb,
Jesus.

18
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:29,468
Holy Mary, mother of God,
pray for us sinners...

19
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:59,071
Almighty God, bless the insignia
of Saint Sebastian the Martyr,

20
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:05,270
that it may contribute to the sacredness
of him to whom it is given.

21
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:24,233
Do you, Michael, promise to be faithful
to the noble purposes of this Order,

22
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:28,791
to have a special care for the poor,
the needy and those who are ill?

23
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:30,757
l do so promise.

24
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:48,438
May the blessing of Almighty God,

25
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:53,355
Father, Son and Holy Spirit

26
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:58,674
descend upon you
and remain with you forever.

27
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:31,597
Vincent, our name is not on the list.

28
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:36,318
Write it in. Mancini. M-A-N-C-l-N-l.

29
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:41,234
- Problem?
- My name isn't on the list.

30
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:46,030
- Then you have to leave immediately.
- You want to dance with me?

31
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:48,714
Joe, it's Vinnie. These are our guests.

32
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:51,519
l'm sorry. l'm sorry, sir.

33
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:53,830
Welcome to the party.

34
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:48,319
- lt's good to see you.
- Good to see you. This is my husband.

35
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:51,074
- Sit down.
- My son, Anthony.

36
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:56,515
The Order of Saint Sebastian is one of
the highest honours the Church awards.

37
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:58,716
lt was first granted by Pope...

38
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:02,190
What about Mr Corleone's connections
with gambling?

39
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:04,431
The press kits have...

40
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:08,195
- And involvement with the underworld?
- Cut the crap.

41
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:11,358
The Pope, the Holy Father himself,

42
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:16,036
has today blessed Michael Corleone.
Do you know better than the Pope?

43
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:19,792
Vincent! She loves you.

44
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:21,712
Yeah?

45
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:26,719
l love you too.

46
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:35,796
Hi, Vincent. l remember you.

47
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:41,113
- From where?
- The last party we were at together.

48
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:45,398
- Did you come to the club?
- No, it was a wedding.

49
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:49,472
l was eight and you were 1 5.

50
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:52,673
l had many girlfriends when l was 1 5.

51
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:54,990
- Eight-year-olds?
- Especially them.

52
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:59,155
Where's Mary?

53
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:03,711
Would somebody please hail Mary?
Excuse me, Your Excellency.

54
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:08,198
You haven't kissed me hello yet.
Relatives always kiss.

55
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:11,875
- Now we're related?
- l'm your little cousin.

56
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:22,270
- Who's your father?
- l'll give you a hint.

57
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:24,958
He's ltalian.

58
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:28,595
Mary, we've been waiting for you.

59
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:32,309
Remember to keep your voice low.

60
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:35,153
And smile. Don't forget to smile.

61
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:58,079
The honorary chairman of
the Vito Corleone Foundation:

62
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:01,790
my daughter, Mary Corleone.

63
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:11,957
Thanks.

64
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:17,839
l think l inherited my father's love
for speechmaking. Here it goes.

65
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:23,352
The Vito Corleone Foundation helps
the poor in every country,

66
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:27,957
gives grants to artists,
funds medical research,

67
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:32,671
and is particularly dedicated
to the resurrection of Sicily.

68
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:34,831
Archbishop Gilday,

69
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:41,189
here is 1 00 million dollars for the poor
of Sicily, in the name of Vito Corleone.

70
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:44,393
Don't spend it all in one place.

71
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:06,399
Mary, l'm so proud of you.

72
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:14,512
Michael...

73
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:17,956
You've done a wonderful thing for Sicily.

74
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:21,908
Let's hope that the money gets
to the people who need it.

75
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:23,399
Amen.

76
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:28,268
...the most important part:
Johnny Fontane!

77
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:39,278
Thank you very much.
l'm happy to be here.

78
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:44,560
l would like you to join me in honouring
Commendatore Michael Corleone.

79
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:52,071
l have something special
for our godfather.

80
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:56,552
l happen to know his favourite song.
Michael, where are you going?

81
00:11:56,720 --> 00:12:00,713
l'm off to the kitchen
to hear some Tony Bennett records.

82
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:04,039
Your favourite song: ''Salsiccia's Own''.

83
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:07,636
l'm having a salsiccia sandwich.
l'll be back.

84
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:42,191
Hello, Kay.

85
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:54,592
Congratulations, Michael.
That's quite an honour.

86
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:57,752
But a little expensive, wouldn't you say?

87
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:02,997
- Cake?
- No, thank you.

88
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:19,193
- lt's been a long time, hasn't it?
- Yeah.

89
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:21,794
- Eight years.
- Yeah.

90
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:24,235
You look wonderful.

91
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:31,990
Your son has something he wants to
talk to you about. l came here for him.

92
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:10,677
- What's wrong with being a lawyer?
- He wants his life to be in music.

93
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:16,272
Music is great, l love music.
But he should finish what he started.

94
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:17,919
Anthony...

95
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:21,152
- l'm going my own way.
- Your own way?

96
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:22,878
- Professional singer?
- Yes.

97
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:26,271
What happens if you fail?

98
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:30,399
- l won't fail.
- Men always believe that.

99
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:34,348
A law degree is like taking out insurance.

100
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:38,638
- After that you can work for me...
- l will never work for you.

101
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:42,039
l have bad memories.

102
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:45,359
Every family has bad memories.

103
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:52,912
l'll always be your son, but won't have
anything to do with your business.

104
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:59,319
Anthony... finish the law degree.

105
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:01,993
No.

106
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:22,113
Well, that he got from you. That ''no''.

107
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:30,119
- You could've helped me convince him.
- Convince him of what?

108
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:32,316
Of what?

109
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:37,190
He throws his life away.
He throws greatness away.

110
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:40,269
This is greatness?

111
00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:45,197
Now that you're so respectable,
you're more dangerous than ever.

112
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:49,672
l preferred you when you were
just a common Mafia hood.

113
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:52,152
Okay.

114
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:56,230
- Can we talk common sense here?
- All right.

115
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:05,632
Tony knows that you killed Fredo.

116
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:14,677
- What did you come here for?
- To protect my son.

117
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:19,868
Not to see you disguised by your
church. That was a shameful ceremony.

118
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:26,639
l spent my life protecting my son.

119
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:30,349
l spent my life protecting my family!

120
00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:33,193
Let's be reasonable, okay?

121
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:38,236
That's your big thing, isn't it, Michael?
Reason.

122
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:42,594
- Backed up by murder.
- Oh, God.

123
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:47,230
- You hate me. You hate me.
- No.

124
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:49,391
l don't hate you.

125
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:53,194
l dread you.

126
00:16:55,840 --> 00:17:02,029
l did what l could, Kay, to protect all
of you from the horrors of this world.

127
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:05,999
But you became my horror.

128
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:18,514
The children still love you, though.
Especially Mary.

129
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:23,155
That's something.

130
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:28,913
We can build on that. For their sake.

131
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:33,951
Let's try.

132
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:39,274
Only if you let Tony go free to have
his own life, away from you.

133
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:48,708
l'll let Tony go.

134
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:52,231
Thank you.

135
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:27,270
- Hi.
- Hi.

136
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:33,914
You could hurt somebody with those.
Let me show you around.

137
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:36,469
Can you get me an interview
with Corleone?

138
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:41,509
No. l'm a relative, but l can't do that.
What else can l do for you?

139
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:44,793
- Handsome, but useless.
- Oh, yeah?

140
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:47,793
- That's okay, l'll gamble.
- Do you like to gamble?

141
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:51,669
Let's go to Atlantic City.
l'll show you how to gamble.

142
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:55,833
- How will l know what numbers to bet?
- Do l look like a loser?

143
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,911
Well...

144
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:01,995
Spooky-looking guy there.

145
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:07,190
- What's a guy like that doing here?
- That's Joey Zasa's bulldog.

146
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:09,954
- You know him?
- Yeah, l do.

147
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:14,796
His name is Anthony Squigilaro.
They call him ''The Ant''.

148
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:17,918
He dips his bullets in cyanide.

149
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:28,070
Don Altobello.

150
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:32,668
- l've come to pay my respects.
- Grazie.

151
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:38,114
You honour my father's friendship.

152
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:41,670
Where is my god-daughter?

153
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:44,479
- Constanza!
- Don Altobello.

154
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:49,236
lt was not so long ago
that l held you in these old hands.

155
00:19:56,840 --> 00:20:01,755
Michael, l've lost all the venom,
all the juice of youth.

156
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:07,438
l've lost the lust for women,
and now my mind is clear.

157
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:14,119
My duty to God is clear.
l have a special favour to ask of you.

158
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:22,316
Can l attach my name
to the Vito Corleone Foundation,

159
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:27,873
so that you and l can be joined
in name and spirit?

160
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:34,436
- One million dollars.
- A lot of money...

161
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:40,954
- Godfather.
- Don Altobello, you have such a heart.

162
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:47,953
Come, let's go and sample
some of that old vino.

163
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:57,591
The Vatican knows nothing
about these shareholders.

164
00:20:57,760 --> 00:20:59,079
Good.

165
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:03,950
l have a tendency to worry. We've
increased our position substantially.

166
00:21:04,120 --> 00:21:09,194
- Naturally, l worry.
- Stop worrying, we have an agreement.

167
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:13,234
Good. How do you think
l got this grey hair?

168
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:17,598
Two seconds... Thank you for your
contribution to the swimming-pool.

169
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:21,793
We need your help on Sam Wallace's
candidacy for judgeship.

170
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:24,315
- We can always use a good judge.
- Thanks.

171
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:25,959
Andrew!

172
00:21:26,120 --> 00:21:30,113
My godson Andrew Hagen.
My brother Tom's eldest boy.

173
00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:34,159
He's been assistant to Bishop Breelan
for three years.

174
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:38,313
- Hopes to be assigned to the Vatican.
- Rome needs fine young priests.

175
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:41,677
His mother Theresa Hagen,
Bishop Gilday.

176
00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:43,712
Honoured to meet you.

177
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:47,038
Mr Corleone. Hi. Grace Hamilton.

178
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:52,591
Vincent Mancini promised to tell you
about me, that maybe you'd see me.

179
00:21:52,760 --> 00:21:55,911
- Did Vincent Mancini call about her?
- No.

180
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:59,231
- You promised to stay out there, twice.
- l know.

181
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:04,949
Joey Zasa showed up.
He's waiting in the lobby.

182
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:08,908
He wants to personally
congratulate you. Show his respect.

183
00:22:09,080 --> 00:22:14,074
- Do l have to see him?
- He says you're his patron.

184
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:19,476
Hey, Vinnie!

185
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,719
- Who's your favourite aunt?
- You are.

186
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:28,590
Today l'll talk to Michael
about your little problem.

187
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:32,795
lf you'd warned me, l would have
worn a better suit.

188
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:36,792
The Meucci Association
has elected you

189
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:39,599
ltalian-American Man of the Year.

190
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,150
Meucci...

191
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:47,708
Who's Meucci?

192
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:53,477
The ltalian-American who invented
the telephone, one year before Bell.

193
00:22:57,280 --> 00:23:00,317
And this is the reason
you've come today?

194
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:09,430
l...

195
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:13,794
l've got a stone in my shoe.

196
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:17,993
A two-bit punk who works for me.

197
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:22,153
The one who thinks he's related to you.

198
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:25,637
A bastard.

199
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:33,231
He's here. Vincent Mancini.
He's at the party.

200
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:38,071
Bring him in.

201
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:42,271
l think it's good that we talk.

202
00:23:42,560 --> 00:23:44,516
No, grazie.

203
00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:48,395
l have a problem...

204
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:54,590
...and l want to find out if it is
my problem or your problem.

205
00:23:54,760 --> 00:24:00,198
Your business is your business. l have
no interests or percentages from it.

206
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:04,315
Good. Then it's my problem.

207
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:12,113
Michael, you know Vincent Mancini.
Sonny's boy.

208
00:24:14,360 --> 00:24:17,238
- How are you, Mr Corleone?
- How are you?

209
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:20,915
- Good. How are you? Good party.
- You like it?

210
00:24:21,080 --> 00:24:24,231
- Yes, l had to sneak in.
- You're dressed for it.

211
00:24:28,680 --> 00:24:33,151
So, what's the trouble
between you and Mr Joe Zasa?

212
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:38,758
- Just trouble. l'll take care of it.
- That's foolish of you.

213
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:44,194
Foolish of me? lt's a little foolish
of this guy, don't you think? Right?

214
00:24:45,280 --> 00:24:48,795
- Right?!
- Temper like his father...

215
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:51,155
Vincent...

216
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:57,234
Mr Joe Zasa now owns what used to
be the Corleone business in New York.

217
00:24:57,400 --> 00:25:01,313
Out of kindness, he gave you
a job in his family.

218
00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:04,199
You took it against my advice.

219
00:25:04,360 --> 00:25:09,115
l offered you something better in the
legitimate world. You turned me down.

220
00:25:09,280 --> 00:25:14,149
Now you both come to me with this bad
blood. What do you expect me to do?

221
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:17,911
- Am l a gangster?
- No...

222
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:22,232
That was Papa's neighbourhood.
Zasa runs it like a disgrace!

223
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:25,870
- That's the past, Connie.
- l earned that territory.

224
00:25:26,040 --> 00:25:29,715
The Commission gave it to me
and you approved.

225
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:31,199
Yes.

226
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:35,751
l came for the party, not to ask for help.
l could kill this bastard.

227
00:25:35,920 --> 00:25:38,070
So kill him.

228
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:41,518
What does all this have to do with me?

229
00:25:41,680 --> 00:25:46,629
Well, he goes behind your back,
saying ''Fuck Michael Corleone''.

230
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:49,234
Say it to his face, one time!

231
00:25:50,680 --> 00:25:55,674
Mr Corleone, all bastards are liars.
Shakespeare wrote poems about it.

232
00:25:55,840 --> 00:25:59,389
What am l going to do with this guy?!

233
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:09,156
Joey, if there's some guy
running around this city,

234
00:26:09,320 --> 00:26:11,675
saying ''Fuck Michael Corleone''...

235
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:17,079
...what do we do
with a piece of shit like that?

236
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:21,352
He's a fucking dog.

237
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:30,670
Yes, it's true. lf anyone would say
such a thing,

238
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:34,276
they would not be a friend,
they would be a dog.

239
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:45,677
- My interests don't conflict with his.
- You don't know how much they do.

240
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:47,432
Quiet, Vincent.

241
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:49,636
He needs your support!

242
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:53,395
Don't let me work for this guy,
let me work for you.

243
00:26:53,560 --> 00:26:59,271
As what? Tough guy? l don't need
tough guys. l need more lawyers.

244
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:07,436
Since we have no conflicts or debts,
l accept your tribute. l wish you well.

245
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:13,636
Vincent, make your peace
with Mr Joe Zasa. Go on.

246
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:25,955
Bastardo...

247
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:33,633
Vinnie, what's the matter with you?!

248
00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:35,995
Get him out of here.

249
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:39,271
Jesus Christ...

250
00:27:40,280 --> 00:27:43,317
- l told Connie this wasn't the right time.
- Close it.

251
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:47,029
l know you're into Wall Street,
but you're still the final word.

252
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:49,953
l want to protect you from these guys.
Your lawyers can't.

253
00:27:50,120 --> 00:27:53,590
- But you can?
- Yeah, l can do that.

254
00:27:54,160 --> 00:27:56,151
Why should l be afraid of Zasa?

255
00:27:56,320 --> 00:27:59,153
You stop him from rising
in the Commission.

256
00:27:59,320 --> 00:28:02,551
l say we make him dead.
Give me the order, l'll do it.

257
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:04,711
- You'll do it?
- Yeah.

258
00:28:08,680 --> 00:28:13,470
Maybe you should come with me
for a few weeks. See what happens.

259
00:28:13,640 --> 00:28:16,598
- Okay.
- See if you learn.

260
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:20,756
And we'll talk about your future.

261
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:23,834
l won't let you down.

262
00:28:29,560 --> 00:28:31,869
lt's about ready.

263
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:38,559
What happened?

264
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:42,395
lf l'm in a room with Zasa,
what happens? l bit his ear off.

265
00:28:42,560 --> 00:28:45,438
Here we go. Watch the card.

266
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:49,079
Hold it!

267
00:28:51,320 --> 00:28:53,038
- Vincent...
- Yeah.

268
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:55,668
Take the picture with us.

269
00:29:02,360 --> 00:29:04,590
Nice jacket.

270
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:08,354
Closer to the centre, sir.

271
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:12,838
Smile!

272
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:36,354
Godfather, this is the cake for you
and your family from Enzo the baker.

273
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:39,235
Do you want to do it?

274
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:25,839
Cent'anni! Cent'anni!

275
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:26,351
- Vincent?
- What do you want, sweetheart?

276
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:30,549
Do you love me?

277
00:31:31,280 --> 00:31:35,478
- Come on, go to bed.
- Come on, say it.

278
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:37,835
l love you.

279
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,560
l love you, too.

280
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:44,350
You've got a cat?

281
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:53,517
Go get us some water, l'm thirsty.
Come on.

282
00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:56,151
Come on.

283
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:05,711
Well, l guess l know my place.

284
00:32:06,280 --> 00:32:09,670
l can't believe l'm actually doing this.

285
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:13,833
''Get me water, bake me a cake''...
What happened to ''please''?

286
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:02,353
Good boy, Sackface. Go for a walk.

287
00:33:10,520 --> 00:33:13,751
- Let her go.
- Cut her throat, man.

288
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:19,111
- What did you say?
- Cut her fucking throat.

289
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:25,037
- Okay, chief...
- Drop your gun or he'll cut her throat.

290
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:28,795
l hardly know her, so cut her.
What the fuck do l care?

291
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:34,475
You've got no choice. She'll be dead.

292
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:38,633
lf you do, l'll kill you both.
Give up that knife, l'll let you go.

293
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:41,075
Cut her throat! Right now!

294
00:33:42,160 --> 00:33:46,836
l'll do something that'll convince you.
Don't get frightened. Just watch me.

295
00:33:51,640 --> 00:33:53,153
Oh, shit!

296
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:57,475
Drop the knife. Drop it!

297
00:33:57,640 --> 00:34:03,351
Good boy. Sit down, l want to talk
to you. lt was a wise choice. Sit down.

298
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:06,151
Lose the mask.

299
00:34:08,840 --> 00:34:12,116
Relax, have a smoke. You smoke?

300
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:16,752
Whose idea was this? Who sent you?

301
00:34:17,080 --> 00:34:19,719
Tell me who sent you.

302
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:24,399
- No one.
- Did you take a look at this guy?

303
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:26,835
- Yeah.
- Who sent you?

304
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:31,675
lt was Joey Zasa.

305
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:47,988
Are you okay?

306
00:34:50,160 --> 00:34:53,152
- You were going to let them kill me!
- No, l wasn't...

307
00:34:53,320 --> 00:34:56,517
You pig! You sick fuck!

308
00:34:57,680 --> 00:35:01,673
You wanted gambling. That's gambling.
Call the police.

309
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:09,754
- You killed the other guy too?
- He went for my gun.

310
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:13,356
lt was self-defence.
Go ahead, call the police.

311
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:16,151
- No, no...
- l'm taking pictures.

312
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:18,550
No pictures.

313
00:35:19,720 --> 00:35:21,073
You had a gun!

314
00:35:21,240 --> 00:35:26,109
They only had a knife. You could have
handed them over to the police.

315
00:35:26,280 --> 00:35:30,034
Zasa sent them.
l just sent him a message.

316
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:35,714
- Now he has to send you one back.
- ls Zasa going to send me one back?

317
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:38,633
He did the right thing.
He got Zasa's name!

318
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:43,794
What has Joey Zasa to do
with anything? Joey Zasa is a pazzo.

319
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:48,553
All right. You are what you are.

320
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:51,758
lt's your nature. Stay close to me.

321
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:55,629
Don't do anything. Keep your mouth
shut and your eyes open.

322
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:58,792
- And you do what l tell you.
- l understand.

323
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:02,714
- l have problems with the Commission.
- l know.

324
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:07,476
- You don't make them easier.
- lt wasn't my idea that this happened.

325
00:36:07,640 --> 00:36:10,438
- Get out of here.
- Michael...

326
00:36:10,600 --> 00:36:12,591
Yes?

327
00:36:13,080 --> 00:36:17,676
- Now they'll fear you.
- Maybe they should fear you.

328
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:24,269
- B.J., what's up?
- The Archbishop just called back.

329
00:36:24,440 --> 00:36:27,318
We've arranged some amazing things.

330
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:32,235
The publicity is phenomenal. You're the
new Rockefeller. A philanthropist.

331
00:36:33,360 --> 00:36:36,989
- Sign here, please.
- Times do change, don't they?

332
00:36:37,160 --> 00:36:42,154
My father hated foundations.
He loved doing it by himself.

333
00:36:42,680 --> 00:36:45,399
Man to man. But we're different.

334
00:36:45,560 --> 00:36:50,270
No different than any large corporation.
We control a lot of money with little.

335
00:36:50,440 --> 00:36:55,070
Minimise taxes.
With no government control.

336
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:06,750
- Godfather.
- Andrew.

337
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:12,757
- Off to Rome...
- l wanted to thank you for everything.

338
00:37:12,920 --> 00:37:15,912
- Do you want some breakfast?
- Thanks, l can't.

339
00:37:16,080 --> 00:37:19,914
- How's your ltalian?
- Devo fare un po' di pratica.

340
00:37:21,080 --> 00:37:23,355
- His father was a great lawyer.
- l know.

341
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:27,991
Didn't live to see him ordained. l did.
Did you ever see one of those?

342
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:31,630
Beautiful. l was so proud.
Let me walk you out.

343
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:35,712
lf you hear any rumours in the Vatican,
let me know.

344
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:38,599
No, Andrew has the true faith.

345
00:37:47,160 --> 00:37:48,957
Don Corleone,

346
00:37:49,120 --> 00:37:53,511
l need your help. And not just
to light a little candle.

347
00:37:54,680 --> 00:38:01,392
My gift was to be able to persuade
people to give to the Holy Church.

348
00:38:02,120 --> 00:38:06,875
Then Rome decides to put me
in charge of the Vatican Bank...

349
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:11,598
...but l was never a true banker.

350
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:18,632
Mea culpa. l trusted my friends.

351
00:38:19,600 --> 00:38:21,909
Friendship and money...

352
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:24,438
Oil and water...

353
00:38:24,600 --> 00:38:26,192
lndeed.

354
00:38:26,360 --> 00:38:33,072
But these ''friends'' used the good name
of the Church to feed their greed.

355
00:38:34,040 --> 00:38:36,600
lf money was lost...

356
00:38:37,600 --> 00:38:40,160
...then l am to blame.

357
00:38:40,760 --> 00:38:46,392
lf only prayer could pay off
our 700 million dollar deficit.

358
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,639
769 million...

359
00:38:56,000 --> 00:39:00,994
The Church owns 25 percent
of a large corporation: lmmobiliare.

360
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:03,831
You know the one l mean?

361
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:08,994
Largest landlord on Earth.
Real estate worth six billion dollars.

362
00:39:10,680 --> 00:39:12,591
That's true.

363
00:39:12,760 --> 00:39:16,753
And the Vatican vote
is necessary for control.

364
00:39:19,160 --> 00:39:22,072
No, you're mistaken.

365
00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:26,438
This isn't a question of one person
deciding, one deciding vote.

366
00:39:26,600 --> 00:39:32,311
This is like any other company.
We have directors and very old rules.

367
00:39:33,080 --> 00:39:37,756
The Pope himself
would have to approve you.

368
00:39:41,640 --> 00:39:43,870
We've sold the casinos.

369
00:39:45,320 --> 00:39:49,108
All businesses having to do
with gambling.

370
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:54,832
We have no interests or investments
in anything illegitimate.

371
00:39:57,520 --> 00:40:02,230
The Corleones are prepared to deposit
500 million dollars in the Vatican Bank

372
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:05,392
when Mr Corleone receives
majority control of lmmobiliare.

373
00:40:05,560 --> 00:40:10,873
lmmobiliare could be something new.
A European conglomerate.

374
00:40:11,880 --> 00:40:16,032
Few families have control
of such a company.

375
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:21,753
lt seems that, in today's world,

376
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:26,914
the power to absolve debt is greater
than the power of forgiveness.

377
00:40:28,080 --> 00:40:30,150
600 million dollars.

378
00:40:34,760 --> 00:40:38,469
Don't overestimate
the power of forgiveness.

379
00:40:39,840 --> 00:40:41,751
Don Corleone,

380
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:46,755
this deal with lmmobiliare can make you
one of the richest men in the world.

381
00:40:46,920 --> 00:40:52,233
Your whole past history, and the history
of your family, would be washed away.

382
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:58,388
600 million.

383
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:17,670
The motion under discussion
relates to Corleone Group's proposal

384
00:41:17,840 --> 00:41:23,233
to acquire 1 00,000,000 newly-issued
Class A voting shares.

385
00:41:24,760 --> 00:41:31,233
... Corleone capital invested directly
into lnternational lmmobiliare,

386
00:41:31,400 --> 00:41:35,154
an old and respected
European company.

387
00:41:35,320 --> 00:41:40,474
Mr Corleone has an ambitious programme
to expand this real estate company

388
00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:43,518
into an international conglomerate...

389
00:41:46,840 --> 00:41:51,630
...by Eastern techniques of efficiency
and focus and unlimited...

390
00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:54,678
Mr Corleone, excuse me.

391
00:41:54,840 --> 00:41:58,355
Didn't you recently deposit 200 million
in the Vatican Bank,

392
00:41:58,520 --> 00:42:01,353
which is affiliated with lmmobiliare?

393
00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:02,999
True. Why not?

394
00:42:03,160 --> 00:42:08,393
Wasn't there any questioning about
the timing on this particular deposit?

395
00:42:09,120 --> 00:42:11,588
Mr Chairman, if l may?

396
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:17,351
The Vito Andolini Corleone Foundation,
of which Mary Corleone is chairman,

397
00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:20,717
has made an endowment
of 1 00 million dollars.

398
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:24,953
The money comes from his own family
and will be administered by the Vatican.

399
00:42:25,120 --> 00:42:27,634
Does that answer your question?

400
00:42:27,800 --> 00:42:33,909
l have always believed that helping your
fellow man is profitable in every sense,

401
00:42:34,080 --> 00:42:36,548
personally and bottom line.

402
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:42,238
My fellow shareholders, if Europe
and America can learn to co-operate,

403
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:46,279
if we can learn to pool our wealth,
share our markets,

404
00:42:46,440 --> 00:42:51,275
we can defeat any competition
anywhere in the world.

405
00:42:51,840 --> 00:42:54,434
Thank you for your time.

406
00:42:54,600 --> 00:42:59,037
l hope that you will look favourably
on my proposal. Thank you.

407
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:07,278
Let me have this microphone here.

408
00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:12,560
Will we let a criminal run our company?
He's got the map of Sicily on his face!

409
00:43:12,720 --> 00:43:14,199
Order!

410
00:43:14,360 --> 00:43:17,272
He's either a Catholic or a mafioso...

411
00:43:18,880 --> 00:43:23,396
The Hamilton lnvestors Group
cannot support this proposal.

412
00:43:23,960 --> 00:43:25,279
Your Excellency...

413
00:43:26,320 --> 00:43:27,799
Mr Chairman...

414
00:43:28,560 --> 00:43:34,556
...the Vatican Bank feels
that lnternational lmmobiliare...

415
00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:40,359
...will be safe in Mr Corleone's hands.

416
00:43:40,520 --> 00:43:45,310
...subject to audit and final ratification,
which must take place in Rome.

417
00:43:45,480 --> 00:43:49,234
Please join me in welcoming
Mr Michael Corleone.

418
00:43:58,840 --> 00:44:00,592
Dad?

419
00:44:02,760 --> 00:44:06,389
Tony says that l'm a front
for the foundation.

420
00:44:07,520 --> 00:44:11,115
That you're using me to pull the strings.

421
00:44:11,280 --> 00:44:14,272
- To get the money where you want it.
- Please!

422
00:44:14,440 --> 00:44:17,477
- To shine up your public image.
- Mary!

423
00:44:18,200 --> 00:44:22,193
Mary, this is real.
This foundation is real.

424
00:44:24,520 --> 00:44:29,355
l wanted Anthony to be part of it.
l thought you would be together on this.

425
00:44:29,520 --> 00:44:33,718
l won't interfere.
l'll help, but only if you ask.

426
00:44:33,880 --> 00:44:36,440
What is this really for?

427
00:44:36,600 --> 00:44:41,230
Why are you doing this?
Why am l doing this?

428
00:44:41,400 --> 00:44:46,315
l'm doing this for my children.
You're doing it for your children too.

429
00:44:46,720 --> 00:44:49,792
This foundation is supposed to
help all people?

430
00:44:49,960 --> 00:44:51,439
That's the purpose.

431
00:44:52,280 --> 00:44:56,876
This is legitimate.
Mary, l swear, this is legitimate.

432
00:45:00,760 --> 00:45:04,150
Dad, l want this to bring me
closer to you.

433
00:45:11,520 --> 00:45:15,752
l would burn in Hell to keep you safe.

434
00:45:28,880 --> 00:45:31,678
Go in the other car. l'll ride with Michael.

435
00:45:31,840 --> 00:45:33,831
Go, go, go.

436
00:45:46,920 --> 00:45:52,711
As your family's oldest friend, l'm
always chosen to bring you messages.

437
00:45:54,840 --> 00:45:57,832
Tell me, Don Altobello.

438
00:45:59,360 --> 00:46:03,353
Your old partners are grateful for
the money you made them.

439
00:46:03,520 --> 00:46:05,829
They worship you...

440
00:46:06,800 --> 00:46:12,670
...but their hearts are broken, because
they think you abandoned them.

441
00:46:13,120 --> 00:46:19,070
They want to share your deal
on lmmobiliare, to be a family again.

442
00:46:19,400 --> 00:46:21,994
lt can purify their money.

443
00:46:23,960 --> 00:46:26,428
This l cannot do.

444
00:46:28,280 --> 00:46:31,989
lmmobiliare must be legitimate.

445
00:46:33,120 --> 00:46:35,554
l know.

446
00:46:35,720 --> 00:46:38,234
But they're unhappy.

447
00:46:39,720 --> 00:46:41,551
And you?

448
00:46:41,720 --> 00:46:47,590
l ask nothing for myself,
only peace in my old age.

449
00:46:47,760 --> 00:46:51,309
But l must please the world around me.

450
00:46:52,440 --> 00:46:58,675
Michael, your father was a
reasonable man. Learn from him.

451
00:47:00,680 --> 00:47:04,150
l learned many things from my father.

452
00:47:09,120 --> 00:47:14,638
Call a meeting, my friend,
so there are no debts or grudges.

453
00:47:15,840 --> 00:47:18,912
We will make the peace, you and l.

454
00:47:26,520 --> 00:47:28,476
The Vatican announced today...

455
00:47:28,640 --> 00:47:32,758
that Pope Paul Vl has canceled
his Sunday blessing...

456
00:47:32,920 --> 00:47:35,070
due to ill health.

457
00:47:35,240 --> 00:47:40,712
His physician has ordered
total bedrest...

458
00:47:40,880 --> 00:47:43,633
and cessation of all activities.

459
00:47:56,760 --> 00:48:02,118
They've had a press conference. The
Pope's condition is grave. ''Gravissimo. ''

460
00:48:27,960 --> 00:48:33,034
The purpose of this meeting
is to ratify...

461
00:48:33,200 --> 00:48:37,113
the motion passed by our
shareholders in New York.

462
00:48:37,880 --> 00:48:39,871
Please...

463
00:48:40,040 --> 00:48:44,511
Our group represents a consortium
of Catholic businessmen

464
00:48:44,680 --> 00:48:47,672
against the Corleone control.

465
00:48:48,120 --> 00:48:52,955
The Vatican has cast its vote. Corleone
Group already controls the Board.

466
00:48:53,240 --> 00:48:57,756
According to the Lateran Treaty,
the Vatican vote must be ratified here.

467
00:48:57,920 --> 00:49:00,480
Here in Rome, by the Pope.

468
00:49:03,800 --> 00:49:07,270
The Pope is gravely ill.

469
00:49:08,160 --> 00:49:12,233
Until he recovers, l am powerless.

470
00:49:12,760 --> 00:49:15,638
- What if he dies?
- Then...

471
00:49:16,560 --> 00:49:19,677
...as you Americans say,
all bets are off.

472
00:49:19,840 --> 00:49:22,400
Gentlemen, please.

473
00:49:23,120 --> 00:49:27,238
This is a brief delay. Nothing more.

474
00:49:31,080 --> 00:49:34,311
Your Excellency, gentlemen...

475
00:49:34,720 --> 00:49:40,192
l advise you to join us in our prayers
for the Holy Father's recovery.

476
00:49:41,240 --> 00:49:42,912
We had an agreement!

477
00:49:44,160 --> 00:49:47,869
This meeting was to be
merely a formality.

478
00:49:48,040 --> 00:49:52,955
- Please sit down.
- l'd rather stand. Give me an answer.

479
00:49:53,120 --> 00:49:58,399
The lmmobiliare has its roots in the
European tradition. Please understand.

480
00:49:59,040 --> 00:50:02,350
l understand.
Your tactics are despicable.

481
00:50:02,520 --> 00:50:05,512
That's quite an indictment,
coming from a Corleone.

482
00:50:05,680 --> 00:50:10,674
- Gentlemen, gentlemen!
- Remember you are in the Vatican.

483
00:50:13,280 --> 00:50:19,116
- What is it that you want?
- Yes, you will take control.

484
00:50:19,760 --> 00:50:23,673
We'll gladly put you at the helm
of our little fleet,

485
00:50:23,840 --> 00:50:27,753
but our ships must all sail
in the same direction.

486
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:34,916
Otherwise, who can say how long
your stay with us will last?

487
00:50:36,560 --> 00:50:42,829
lt's not personal. lt's only business.
You should know, Godfather.

488
00:50:46,040 --> 00:50:47,473
Very well.

489
00:50:48,600 --> 00:50:53,435
You want to do business with me?
l will do business with you.

490
00:50:54,400 --> 00:50:56,994
Vipers, all of them.

491
00:51:02,040 --> 00:51:05,032
- We're back with the Borgias!
- Uncle Michael...

492
00:51:05,200 --> 00:51:08,078
- Andrew!
- l heard you were here.

493
00:51:08,240 --> 00:51:12,472
lt's so nice to see you.
Vincent, it's so nice.

494
00:51:12,640 --> 00:51:15,677
What is this about the Borgias?
Those days are over.

495
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:23,798
- Recognise it?
- Yeah.

496
00:51:24,560 --> 00:51:29,270
Genco Olive Oil. That's where our
grandfather started as a delivery boy.

497
00:51:29,440 --> 00:51:32,238
Three years later he owned it.

498
00:51:32,680 --> 00:51:35,672
- Only in America.
- That's it.

499
00:51:35,840 --> 00:51:40,834
Vincenzo, where have you been hiding?
We need your help so badly.

500
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:44,993
- What can l do for you?
- Get rid of Joe Zasa. He sells drugs...

501
00:51:45,160 --> 00:51:49,472
Now that l'm an older woman,
l'm afraid to go out at night.

502
00:51:49,640 --> 00:51:51,790
Where should they be now?

503
00:51:51,960 --> 00:51:54,952
- Lou, what's going on?
- We're late.

504
00:51:56,720 --> 00:51:59,188
- Have l ever let you down?
- l trust you.

505
00:51:59,360 --> 00:52:01,669
- Don't worry.
- Thank you.

506
00:52:01,840 --> 00:52:03,558
Enjoy yourselves.

507
00:52:09,720 --> 00:52:14,032
- What was that?
- The neighbourhood's in trouble.

508
00:52:14,440 --> 00:52:17,079
- Do you keep an eye out for them?
- Yes.

509
00:52:17,240 --> 00:52:20,118
- And for me?
- From now on.

510
00:52:20,920 --> 00:52:24,754
- l've missed you all this time.
- l missed you too, cousin.

511
00:52:24,920 --> 00:52:29,948
l missed growing up with my cousins.
l didn't even know you, but missed you.

512
00:52:30,520 --> 00:52:34,832
Do you remember stories
about our fathers? The old days?

513
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:37,992
Yeah, what do you want to know?

514
00:52:39,560 --> 00:52:45,237
- What was Sonny like?
- Well, he was the Prince of the City.

515
00:52:46,160 --> 00:52:49,914
He died before l was born,
but l've heard a lot about him.

516
00:52:51,400 --> 00:52:55,029
- What about my father?
- He's a great man.

517
00:52:56,240 --> 00:52:58,959
He's a hero. He saved the family.

518
00:53:00,160 --> 00:53:02,151
- Vincent?
- What?

519
00:53:02,320 --> 00:53:04,788
Did he kill his own brother?

520
00:53:08,720 --> 00:53:10,551
No.

521
00:53:12,440 --> 00:53:14,874
So, it's all lies?

522
00:53:17,920 --> 00:53:21,515
Just stories, sweetheart. Okay?

523
00:53:25,120 --> 00:53:26,838
Okay.

524
00:53:28,120 --> 00:53:30,350
l believe you.

525
00:53:30,520 --> 00:53:34,433
- l'm glad you're around.
- l'm glad you're here too.

526
00:53:38,760 --> 00:53:40,716
Cugina...

527
00:53:40,920 --> 00:53:42,911
Cous...

528
00:53:56,160 --> 00:53:59,391
l'd like to take Joey Zasa for a ride
in this and drop him.

529
00:53:59,560 --> 00:54:02,199
Joey Zasa is nothing.

530
00:54:02,360 --> 00:54:06,069
He's a small-time enforcer.
He bluffs and threatens.

531
00:54:06,240 --> 00:54:10,074
He's nothing. You can see him coming
a mile away.

532
00:54:10,720 --> 00:54:13,712
- We should kill him before he...
- No!

533
00:54:16,160 --> 00:54:20,756
Never hate your enemies.
lt affects your judgement.

534
00:54:35,800 --> 00:54:38,394
Nice to see you again, Mr Corleone.

535
00:54:58,040 --> 00:55:00,679
Hey, girls. Let's go.

536
00:55:17,160 --> 00:55:21,438
We trusted you to manage
our money in the casinos.

537
00:55:21,600 --> 00:55:27,197
lt's not even 20 years. You've sold the
casinos and made fortunes for all of us.

538
00:55:27,360 --> 00:55:29,669
Bravo, Don Corleone!

539
00:55:31,400 --> 00:55:32,719
Thank you.

540
00:55:33,640 --> 00:55:40,637
Friends, l have come here
because our business together is done.

541
00:55:41,720 --> 00:55:43,438
We have prospered,

542
00:55:43,600 --> 00:55:49,311
and now it is time for us to dissolve
the business relationship between us.

543
00:55:50,560 --> 00:55:52,516
That's it.
